<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

<p>
MyRiskScout (“we”, “us”, “our”) provides a mobile application that visualises 
neighbourhood-level crime risk based on public and environmental data. 
We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in how 
we use data.
</p>

<h2>1. What data we do <strong>not</strong> collect</h2>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your name</li>
  <li>Your contact details (unless you contact us yourself)</li>
  <li>Your movement history or GPS trails</li>
  <li>Personal profiles for marketing or advertising</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Location data (optional)</h2>
<p>
The app uses your device’s location <strong>only if you enable it</strong>. 
Location is used temporarily on your device to determine:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Which neighbourhood you are currently in</li>
  <li>Whether a risk alert should be triggered</li>
</ul>

<p>
Your location is <strong>not stored</strong>, <strong>not transmitted</strong>, 
and <strong>not used to identify you</strong>.
</p>

<h2>3. Analytics</h2>
<p>
We may use privacy-friendly analytics to understand app usage 
(e.g., which screens are visited, how often the app is opened). These analytics:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do not track personal identity</li>
  <li>Do not use invasive cookies</li>
  <li>Do not collect precise location</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. What data we use to generate risk scores</h2>
<p>
Risk scores are based entirely on:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Official crime statistics (public or licensed datasets)</li>
  <li>Neighbourhood-level demographic and socio-economic data</li>
  <li>Environmental and structural indicators (e.g. housing type, density)</li>
</ul>

<p>
This data is aggregated at neighbourhood level and 
<strong>never tied to individuals</strong>.
</p>

<h2>5. Contact and enquiries</h2>
<p>
If you contact us (for example via email or contact form), we will use the 
information you provide (such as your email address and your message) only 
to respond to your enquiry.
</p>

<h2>6. Data retention</h2>
<p>
We store no personal identifiable information from app usage. 
Anonymous or aggregated analytics are kept only as long as needed to 
monitor and improve app performance.
</p>

<h2>7. Third parties</h2>
<p>
We do not sell or rent any personal data to third parties. 
If we use third-party services (e.g. analytics providers), we select them 
with care and, where applicable, ensure appropriate data protection safeguards.
</p>

<h2>8. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most recent version 
will always be available on this page, with the date of the latest update 
indicated at the top.
</p>
