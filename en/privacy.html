    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="meta">Last updated: <strong>22 January 2026</strong></div>

    <p>
      MyRiskScout B.V. (“MyRiskScout”, “we”, “us” or “our”) takes your privacy seriously.
      This Privacy Policy explains what information we process when you use our app, why we do it,
      and what choices you have.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Who is responsible for processing?</h2>
    <p>The controller for processing your personal data is:</p>
    <p>
      <strong>MyRiskScout B.V.<br>
      Amsterdam, the Netherlands<br>
      Email: <a href="mailto:info@myriskscout.com">info@myriskscout.com</a></strong>
    </p>

    <h2>2. What data do we process?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Location data (only with permission):</strong>
        GPS or network-based location to determine your neighborhood and to make risk information and alerts relevant.
        We aim not to store detailed movement histories.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Notifications (only with permission):</strong>
        if you allow push notifications, we use a technical token to send notifications to your device.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>App usage & technical data:</strong>
        screens viewed, device model, OS version, app version and (pseudo-)anonymous identifiers for analytics and troubleshooting.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Subscription and purchase status:</strong>
        whether Premium is active (e.g., free trial or active subscription), solely to manage feature access.
        We do not receive or process payment card details.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Contact data:</strong>
        only if you provide it yourself via the contact form or email.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
      <p style="margin:0;">
        <strong>Note:</strong> payments and subscriptions are handled by the Apple App Store or Google Play. We do not receive payment details.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>3. App permissions (location & notifications)</h2>
    <p>
      We request permissions only when needed for functionality:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Location while using the app (foreground):</strong>
        on first use, the app may request permission to access your location while the app is open. This helps determine your neighborhood.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Background location & push notifications:</strong>
        we request these only when you activate Premium and choose to use features that require them (e.g., alerts in high-risk zones).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can always change permissions in your device settings. If you deny a permission, basic features remain available,
      but some Premium features (such as alerts) may be limited.
    </p>

    <h2>4. What purposes do we use your data for?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Show risk scores:</strong> location (if allowed) helps display the right neighborhood information.</li>
      <li><strong>Send alerts and notifications:</strong> only if you use Premium and grant background location/push permissions.</li>
      <li><strong>Improve the app:</strong> (aggregated) statistics and crash reports help increase stability and usability.</li>
      <li><strong>Respond to questions:</strong> if you contact us, we use your data to handle your request.</li>
      <li><strong>Prevent misuse:</strong> technical data helps detect and reduce security incidents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Legal bases for processing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> for location data and push notifications (where applicable).</li>
      <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> to provide the app and grant Premium access.</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> analytics, security and app improvement (with minimal impact on your privacy).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Who do we share data with?</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your data. We may use processors such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hosting and cloud providers</li>
      <li>Analytics and crash reporting tools</li>
      <li>Push notification services</li>
      <li>Subscription/purchase handling (via Apple App Store / Google Play and, if applicable, a subscription provider)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We enter into data processing agreements with these parties. Data is preferably processed within the EEA;
      if processing occurs outside the EEA, we ensure appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses).
    </p>

    <h2>7. How long do we retain data?</h2>
    <p>
      We do not keep personal data longer than necessary for the purposes described:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location data:</strong> we aim not to store detailed location histories; where temporary processing is required, we keep it as short as possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical logs & analytics:</strong> retention depends on the tool and purpose (stability/improvement) and is limited to what is necessary.</li>
      <li><strong>Support requests:</strong> as long as needed to respond and follow up.</li>
      <li><strong>Subscription status:</strong> as long as needed to manage Premium access and comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data against loss, misuse and unauthorized access.
      No system is 100% secure, but we take reasonable steps to minimize risks.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Your rights</h2>
    <p>
      You may have the right (subject to conditions) to access, correct, delete, restrict processing, object, and request data portability.
      You can also withdraw consent at any time (e.g., via your device settings).
    </p>
    <p>
      To exercise your rights, contact us at
      <a href="mailto:info@myriskscout.com">info@myriskscout.com</a>.
      You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Children</h2>
    <p>
      MyRiskScout is not intended for children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
      If you believe we may have collected data from a child, please contact us so we can delete it.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most recent version is always available on our website.
      If changes are significant, we will inform you via the app or our website.
