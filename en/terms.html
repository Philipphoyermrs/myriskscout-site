    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <div class="meta">Last updated: <strong>22 January 2026</strong></div>

    <p>
      These Terms of Use apply to your use of the MyRiskScout app and related services.
      By installing or using the app, you agree to these terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Purpose of the app</h2>
    <p>
      MyRiskScout helps you view neighborhood-level risk indicators and make more informed choices about, for example,
      bicycle parking, route planning, or where to live. Risk levels are based on historical data and models.
      They are provided for informational purposes only and are not individualized advice or a guarantee.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Subscriptions, free trials and payments</h2>
    <p>
      MyRiskScout may offer paid features via subscriptions (e.g., monthly subscriptions), optionally including a free trial.
      Available options, pricing and durations are shown in the app.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Free trial:</strong> if you start a free trial, it will convert into a paid subscription unless you cancel in time.</li>
      <li><strong>Auto-renewal:</strong> subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled through your App Store or Google Play account.</li>
      <li><strong>Managing and cancelling:</strong> you manage and cancel subscriptions via your Apple ID or Google Play account settings (not inside MyRiskScout).</li>
      <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> prices may change; any changes will be presented in the store or in the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
      <p style="margin:0;">
        <strong>Restore purchases:</strong> if you have already purchased a subscription, you can restore it in the app using “Restore purchases”.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>3. No warranty</h2>
    <p>
      While we strive to keep information accurate and up to date, we do not guarantee that all data is complete, correct,
      or current. Use of the app is at your own risk.

    <h2>4. Responsible use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You may not use the app in a way that violates applicable laws.</li>
      <li>You may not misuse the app (e.g., hacking, scraping, reverse engineering).</li>
      <li>You may not use the app to stalk, monitor or otherwise harm others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>
      All content in the app (including maps, risk scores, text, logos and designs) is owned by MyRiskScout or its licensors
      and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.

    <ul>
      <li>Indirect or consequential damages, or lost profits.</li>
      <li>Damages resulting from decisions you make based on information in the app.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>7. Changes to the app and terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may modify or update the app and these Terms at any time. If changes are significant, we will communicate this
      in the app or on our website. By continuing to use the app, you agree to the updated Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      You may stop using the app at any time by uninstalling it from your device.
      Subscriptions must be cancelled via your App Store or Google Play account.
      We may suspend or discontinue (parts of) the service temporarily or permanently.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Governing law</h2>
